In this question we were given with a png
When you look at the challenge description : Look up in the BLUE sky ! It's a bird, it's a PLANE or wait .. It's both ? But how ?

there he is not sure the it's a bird or plane. He is not sure about the thing because he can't see them.

So I thought that the flag might be hidden in the png.
When i opened the image i can't see anything except a mono colour so i thought the flag might be hidden so i used
online png analyser then i found this link:

after uploading the image in the link in the hidden pixel i got the flag:
inctfj{th3_fl4g_wa5_liter4lly_ins1de_4_m3me}
