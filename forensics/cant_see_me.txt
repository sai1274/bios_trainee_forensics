In question you were given with a image with format .PNG  whose magical number is 89 50 4E 47 
When we are trying to open the image it will show you an error so you need to rectify it.
with the help of ghex editor we can edit the magical number after changing the magical number to png
magical number still you can open it because it is caused by the chunk errors.
we can't fing them all manually so we are gonna use the below command :

	"pngcheck -v image.png"

on running this command it will show you the errors you need to rectify it manually at last we can 
open the image and there we can see the flag:
