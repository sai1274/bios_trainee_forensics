In the question you were given with a png file.
we have two hints we'll use hint 2. we will use strings:
	
	"strings imsge.png"

The command dumps all the readable characters in the png. At the end we can see a paste bin link
on going through the link we can get an encrypted flag: 
	
	"ZmxhZ3tNMTVzSTBOX2FDYzBNUEwxNWgzRH0="	

Since we all are readable characters and there is no key try using various online decoder.
when i tried using base64 online decoder i got the flag:

	"flag{M15sI0N_aCc0MPL15h3D}"

we can decode base64 in out terminal using the command:

	"string".decode('base64')
